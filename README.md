## Project Description
This project is a web application developed with React that consumes a Stephen King books API. The application allows users to view a list of books and see the details of each one.

### APIs Used
- **Books**: `https://stephen-king-api.onrender.com/api/books`
- **Book Details**: `https://stephen-king-api.onrender.com/api/book/{id}`

## Technologies and Language
- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **JavaScript**: Programming language used for the application development.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the application.

## How It Works
The application displays a list of books fetched from the API. Clicking on a book shows a card with the details of the selected book. The detail card includes information such as the title, publication year, publisher, ISBN, number of pages, notes, and villains. There is also a button to return to the list of books.

## Instructions to Use the Project

### 1. Download the Project
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NMEJIA93/electiva1_appbooks_norbeyMejia_deibyRendon.git
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

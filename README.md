## Project Description
This project is a web application developed with React that consumes a Stephen King books API. The application allows users to view a list of books and see the details of each one.

### APIs Used
- **Books**: `https://stephen-king-api.onrender.com/api/books`
- **Book Details**: `https://stephen-king-api.onrender.com/api/book/{id}`

## Technologies and Language
- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **JavaScript**: Programming language used for the application development.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the application.

## How It Works
The application displays a list of books fetched from the API. Clicking on a book shows a card with the details of the selected book. The detail card includes information such as the title, publication year, publisher, ISBN, number of pages, notes, and villains. There is also a button to return to the list of books.
